# Housing Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based application that predicts house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. The prediction model is built using TensorFlow and scikit-learn.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```shell
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sanmuga/Housing-price-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd housing-price-prediction
```

## Usage

This project consists of a machine learning model for predicting house prices. To use the model, follow these steps:

1. [Dataset](#dataset): Prepare your dataset or use the provided sample dataset.
2. [Training the Model](#training-the-model): Train the machine learning model on your dataset.
3. [Making Predictions](#making-predictions): Use the trained model to make predictions for new data.

## Dataset

You can use your own dataset for house price prediction. The dataset should be in CSV format with columns for features and a target variable (price). The sample dataset is provided in the "sample_dataset.csv" file.

Ensure that your dataset includes the following columns:
- area
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
- stories
- mainroad
- guestroom
- basement
- hotwaterheating
- airconditioning
- parking
- prefarea
- furnishingstatus
- price

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
housing-price-prediction/
  ├── model.py               # Contains the machine learning model code
  ├── predict.py             # Script to make predictions using the trained model
  ├── sample_dataset.csv     # Sample dataset for testing
  ├── README.md              # This README file
  └── requirements.txt       # List of required packages
```

## Training the Model

To train the machine learning model on your dataset, you can modify the "model.py" script to load your dataset, preprocess it, and train the model. You may need to customize the model architecture based on your data and requirements.

Run the training script:

```shell
python model.py
```

The trained model will be saved for making predictions.

## Making Predictions

You can make predictions using the trained model by providing input data with the same format as the training data. Use the "predict.py" script for this purpose.

Run the prediction script:

```shell
python predict.py
```

The predicted house prices will be displayed.

## Evaluation

You can evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2). These metrics can be calculated in the "model.py" script or using your preferred evaluation method.
